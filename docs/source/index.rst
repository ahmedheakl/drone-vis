Welcome to DroneVis's documentation!
====================================

**DroneVis** is a full compatible drone library to automate computer vision algorithms on parrot drones. The library and computer vision alogirthms were built with real-time constraints on-mind. 

All of the implemented real-time data, inference, and detection achieve a minimum ``fps >= 4.5`` on an *Intel core 8* CPU.

Check out the :doc:`guides/install` section for further information, including how to
install the project.

Drone Controls
--------------
The library supports all of the following drone controls. The drone can be controlled using the keyboard or the GUI.


- Right ➡️, Left ⬅️
- Up ⬆️, Down ⬇️
- Forward ▶️, Backward ◀️
- Takeoff 🚀, Land 🛬
- Reset 🔄, Emergency 🚨
- Rotate Left ↩️ /Right ↪️
- Hover 🔍, Calibrate 🔧
- Camera Stream 📹/Record ⏺️
- Hand Gesture Control 🖌️
