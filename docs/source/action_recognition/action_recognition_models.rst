Action Recognition Models
=========================

Action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves the analysis of video sequences to identify and categorize specific human actions
or activities. Action recognition with drones holds significant importance in various fields due to its potential to enhance safety and decision-making.
By accurately identifying and tracking human actions or movements from an aerial perspective, drones can play a crucial role in security and surveillance
operations, enabling rapid response to potential threats or emergencies. Additionally, drones equipped with action recognition capabilities in sports and
entertainment can capture dynamic and engaging footage, enhancing the viewer experience. For this task, we offer three different video recognition models
that achieve state-of-the-art results on well-known video recognition datasets.

We developed a common class for all action recognition models:
