# DroneVis: Full compatible drone library to automate computer vision algorithms on parrot drones.

**DroneVis** is a cutting-edge drone software library that has been specifically designed for use with the AR. Drone 2.0. It has been extensively tested both indoors and outdoors, and offers a wide range of features including adaptability in connecting to the drone, advanced computer vision algorithms, and a user-friendly interface. This makes it easy for users to take full advantage of the drone's capabilities and control it with simple commands.All of the implemented real-time data, inference, and detection achieve a minimum ``fps >= 4.5`` on an Intel core 8 CPU.

## Features
- Unified state-of-the art computer vision algoritms
- Full control over the drone
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
- Tests, high code coverage and type hints
- Clean code
- Multiple implementations for the same models
- Logger with timestamps
- Two UI for easier usage (GUI, CLI)

## How to Install 

You start controling your drone now with just two commands:

```bash
pip install dronevis # install the library 
dronevis-gui # run library GUI
```

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/dronevis-gui.png" width=700>
</p>

Press the ``start`` button to start a demo drone simulation, and run your favourite algorithms with the ``stream`` button.


<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/dronevis-gui-demo.png" width=700>
</p>

You can control your drone with our ``CLI``:
```bash
dronevis
```

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/dronevis-cli.png" width=400>
</p>

> :warning: **If you are a Windows**: models implemented with Mxnet library are buggy.

## Getting Started 

Dronevis is built with multiple modes for customizibility. You can view all the options for either runnning our ``GUI`` or ``CLI`` as follows: 

```bash
dronevis --help
```

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/dronevis-cli-help.png" width=500>
</p>

The default mode for running either the CLI or the GUI is the ``demo`` mode. You can alter the mode by providing "real" to ``--drone`` argument.

```bash
dronevis --drone=real # cli real drone mode
```

or for GUI,

```bash
dronevis-gui --drone=real # gui real drone mode
```

## Documentation 

Dronevis is developed with an extensive documentation for easier user contributions. You can check our full documentation in [here](drone-vis.readthedocs.io/en/latest) to go more in-depth of **how the library is structure** and **how to contribute your favourite model**.
