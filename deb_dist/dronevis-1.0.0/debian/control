 # DroneVision
 .
 Drone Vision (DroneVis) is a full compatible drone library to automate computer vision algorithms on parrot drones. You can read a detailed documentation of Drone Vision [docs](https://drone-vis.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
 .
 **DroneVis** is a cutting-edge drone software library that has been specifically designed for use with the AR. Drone 2.0. It has been extensively tested both indoors and outdoors, and offers a wide range of features including adaptability in connecting to the drone, advanced computer vision algorithms, and a user-friendly interface. This makes it easy for users to take full advantage of the drone's capabilities and control it with simple commands.All of the implemented real-time data, inference, and detection achieve a minimum ``fps >= 4.5`` on an Intel core 8 CPU.
 .
 ## Features
 - Unified state-of-the art computer vision algoritms
 - Full control over the drone
 - PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
 - Documented functions and classes
 - Tests, high code coverage and type hints
 - Clean code
 - Multiple implementations for the same models
